# Boston CityScore Metrics Analysis ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview
This project analyzes Boston's CityScore dataset to evaluate the city's performance across various municipal services, including public safety, public health, infrastructure maintenance, and city responsiveness. The goal was to explore trends, highlight key areas of strength and concern, and provide actionable insights through data-driven storytelling.

## Objective
- Analyze Boston's CityScore metrics to assess government service performance.
- Visualize trends in public safety, emergency response, infrastructure maintenance, and constituent satisfaction.
- Provide executive-level insights to inform city planning and public engagement strategies.

## Dataset
